    <h1><center>Apple's iPhone 5c isn't the low-cost phone you've been waiting for</center></h1>
    <center><img src="iPhone-5c-image.jpg" alt ="iPhone-5c-image"></center>
    <p> <b>The iPhone 5c</b>, simply put, is for those who've grown numb to Apple's largely evolutionary
        takes on its primary iPhone range. It'll attract a younger audience that cares less about finely
        beveled edges and more about playing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-09-10-iphone-5s-and-5c-cases.html"> Connect 4 on their iPhone case</a>.
        It'll cater to the same <span style="color: lawngreen;"><i>crowd that has looked</i></span> longingly towards the $599 (again, off-contract) 
        <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-08-05-motorola-moto-x-review.html"> Moto X</a> -- a phone for the
        mainstream, and a phone that's as colorful as one's soul. In a way, this is the anti-Moto X. From a
        price, spec and feature perspective, it's a match that's too close to call. The iPhone 5c's camera
        <span style="color: red;"> has</span> an edge on the <span style="color: red;">Moto X</span>, <i>but the X's Active Display</i> is a boon for notifications. As these things
        tend to go, a lot of it boils down to ecosystem preference. The iPhone 5c is being built for the
        same audience as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-09-07-ipod-nano-review-2010.html">flashy iPod nano</a>, and moreover, Apple built it for those on <u>Wall Street</u>
        who feel that it simply <i>must</i> attract new markets to stay atop its game.</p>
        <b><hr></b>
    <p>Apple never showed intentions of racing the <b><u>Nexus 7 </u></b>to the bottom in the tablet game, and the
        <b><i>iPhone 5c</i></b> is proof that it won't do that in the phone arena, either.
